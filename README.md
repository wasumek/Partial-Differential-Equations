# Partial Differential Equations (PDE) Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that solve various Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using numerical methods. PDEs are critical in modeling phenomena in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics, including heat diffusion, wave propagation, and fluid dynamics. The projects in this repository focus on implementing finite difference methods and other numerical techniques to approximate solutions to these equations.

## Overview

Partial Differential Equations describe how physical quantities evolve over space and time. Analytical solutions to PDEs are often difficult or impossible to obtain for complex systems, making numerical methods essential. This repository uses MATLAB to demonstrate numerical solutions to a variety of PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, and Laplace's equation. These methods are foundational in fields such as fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.

## Projects

1. **Heat Equation**:
    - Implements the finite difference method to solve the heat equation, which models heat conduction over time. The simulation demonstrates temperature distribution changes in a rod or plate under varying boundary conditions.

2. **Wave Equation**:
    - Solves the 1D wave equation using explicit time-stepping methods. This project models the propagation of waves in a medium and includes both fixed and periodic boundary conditions.

3. **Laplace's Equation**:
    - This project provides numerical solutions to Laplaceâ€™s equation, a fundamental elliptic PDE used to model steady-state heat distribution, electrostatics, and incompressible fluid flow.

## Installation
